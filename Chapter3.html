<h1>Chapter3</h1>

<p> It's been a year of visiting Earth by Aliens. All the planets that will fight in the tournament showed up on Mars. All they arrived at the stadium where all fights will begin. The organizers spoke to explain everything that will happen in the next one month. Each of the planets has been assigned to a separate building, so they can get ready to the fight in silence. The tournament will begin tomorrow, but today, competitors have little time to get familiar with the schedule of the tournament and a special base.</p>

<p>That day finally arrived. Tournament came to a total of 50 fighters representing five different planets: Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn and Earth. Fighters got familiar with the plan of fighting. Regulations was simple : whoever will loose is out of the tournament. Organizers predicted 5 stages of the tournament plus final. Aliens keep track of the strongest fighter from Earth who's name is Guru. In his first fight he was supposed to face a fighter from planet Saturn. The fight was a fast although in some elements the stranger surprised Guru. In the second round, Guru faced a fighter from the planet Venus. Another win for Earth. Into the third round only 16 fighters proceeded. Unfortunately, only 2 of them are warriors from Earth.</p>

<p>Aliens from other planets are much stronger. The third and fourth round performed by Guru were excellent and won again. In the fifth round (semifinals) Guru faced incredible warrior from Saturn. Once again, he won his fight. He is very intelligent and knows how to read the weak points of the enemy. In the other semifinals Mars and Jupiter faced each other. The fight ended by K.O. Fighter from Mars who's name is Ali won this fight. In such a way they were knocked out 48 fighters and unbeaten are Guru from Earth and Ali from Mars.</p>

<p> Final lasted very long, Ali had advantage for most of the fight. It seemed that he almost fnished his opponent, but Ali was too sure of himself. He committed one mistake which Guru used and knocked out Ali. Everyone was surprised and Guru experiencing moments of his life. Guru was awarded and got the trophy for the best warrior in the galaxy. After a month of fighting everyone went back home and lived happily ever after.</p>
