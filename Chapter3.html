<h1>Chapter3</h1>

<p> It's been a year of visiting Earth by Aliens. All the planets that will fight in the tournament showed up on Mars. All they arrived at the stadium where all fights will begin. The organizers spoke to explain everything that will happen in the next one month. Each of the planets has been assigned to a separate building, so they can get ready to the fight in silence. The tournament will begin tomorrow, but today, competitors have little time to get familiar with the schedule of the tournament and a special base.</p>
