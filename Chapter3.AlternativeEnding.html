<h1>Chapter3.AlternativeEnding</h1>

<p>That big day finally has arrived . All the best fighters from the galaxy will be on Mars. The trip took a couple of days. Everyone appeared in a special base built by the Aliens. Every planet got its own place to sleep and prepare for the tournament. However, when the warriors from the Earth went to their spot, something began to worry them. Their place looked like a prison. The windows had bars, the doors were non-standard. Everything was electronically controlled. However, they couldn’t do anything, because nobody was expecting the worst. They all came there to win the tournament.</p>

<p>On the first night all of them woke up a loud sound. All doors were closed and warriors who should fight were imprisoned in their rooms. All the buildings were built around the corner so from the window it was clear to see what was going on in the other parts of the base. Unfortunately, each planet was imprisoned by the Aliens in its special base. There was no chance of getting out of there.</p>
